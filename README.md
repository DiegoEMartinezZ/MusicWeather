# Music Weather 1.0

Music Weather allows the user to select a country\* and then one of the cities in that country, when this information is selected a play button will appear,

which will bring the weather information of the city.

Ideal tool for the general public, travelers/tourists, event organizers and people interested in technology and data.

## Start using the app üöÄ

These instructions will allow you to get a copy of the project running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

NOTE: For safety reasons I can not share my backend server because it has the different API keys that I am using in the app, so for this reason it is neccesary that you create your own backend server.

### Installation üîß

The first step is to clone this repository on your local machine, for that we use the following command.

```
git clone "https://github.com/DiegoEMartinezZ/musicWeather"
```

The next step, once you have opened the project, is to install the dependencies with this command.

```
npm install
```

## Running the tests ‚öôÔ∏è

Inside the project you will find the file MusicWeatherContext.jsx this file has all the functionalities for the application to work correctly.

I recommend, if you are going to test new features, to add them in this file.

For example, the call to the different APIs can be found in this file. Remember I am using a backend server that I can not share for safety reasons.

```
MusicWeatherContext.jsx
```

## Deploy üì¶

For the application to start working, inside the terminal enter the following command.
